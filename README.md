# AppLab - Project Responsive Website

live page: https://aesthetic-kitten-937381.netlify.app/

Welcome to my project, which was one of the tasks in my mentoring program - AppLab, responsive website! AppLab is designed to promote various mobile applications. The project was developed using HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: AppLab is designed to look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **BEM Methodology**: I learned and applied the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes to ensure the code is modular and maintainable.
- **Semantic HTML**: I learned to use proper semantic tags for different sections of the website, improving both accessibility and SEO.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

## What I Learned

- **Responsive Web Design**: How to create layouts that work on different screen sizes using media queries.
- **BEM Naming Convention**: How to organize CSS classes using the BEM methodology for better code readability and maintainability.
- **Semantic HTML**: How to use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to enhance the meaning of the web content and improve accessibility.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my mentor for their keen eye and for pointing out my mistakes during code reviews, which significantly reinforced my learning process.
